IMPORTANT: THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAIN EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTY.

This Agreement is between you and Teams Work Ltd.

Teams Work may modify this Agreement periodically, subject to the terms in the "Changes to this Agreement" section below.

---

## 3. Types of Teams Work Products

This Agreement covers Teams Work's commercially available software products and services ("Software"), including those that are downloadable, as well as cloud-based products and services ("Hosted Services"). It also applies to any related support or maintenance services provided by Teams Work.

Both Software and Hosted Services (as detailed below) are collectively referred to as "Products."

Please note that some elements of Software may be available through Hosted Services and vice versa. In such cases, all relevant terms in this Agreement will still apply to those elements.

### 3.1 Software

Software includes products that can be fully downloaded or have downloadable components or applications. It also encompasses computer software and source code, as well as associated media, icons, images, text files, PDFs, and other static non-code assets contained within any form of software, printed materials, online and electronic documentation, and internet-based services.

In the Atlassian context, Software includes (without limitation) various categories of Teams Work products (including add-ons) for Atlassian's Data Center applications, available under a subscription license.

### 3.2 Hosted Services

Hosted Services consist of products and services that are commercially available via a cloud-based platform (or SaaS mechanism). In the Atlassian context, this includes Cloud variants of products available through Atlassian Cloud platforms.

---

## 4. Orders

"Order" refers to an online order form, invoice, or other ordering document provided by Teams Work or a third-party partner or marketplace (such as Atlassian's Marketplace) that details the Products, licenses, and services you are purchasing. It may also specify the permitted scope of use for these items.

An Order typically includes: (i) a description of the Products, (ii) the number of Authorized Users, Subscription Term or License Term, any associated domain(s), and other usage parameters, (iii) for paid Orders, details such as the charge amount or rate, billing and renewal terms, applicable currency, and payment method.

Additionally, Orders may describe extra services like support and No-Charge Products.

---

## 5. Account Registration

5.1 You may need to register for one or more of the following, so that you may place Orders, or access or receive any Products:

- an Atlassian account
- a Slack account

---

## 6. Authorized Users, Integrated Partner's EULAs, and third party services terms

Unless otherwise agreed in writing with us, only the individuals for whom you have paid the necessary fees and who are designated through the applicable Product ("Authorized Users") may access and use the Products. Authorized Users may include yourself, your Affiliates' employees, representatives, consultants, contractors, agents, or other third parties acting on your behalf. You are responsible for paying the appropriate fee for any additional Authorized Users and ensuring that all Authorized Users comply with this Agreement. All use of the Products by you and your Authorized Users must fall within the agreed scope and be solely for the benefit of you or your Affiliates.

### 6.1 Integrated Partner Terms

Certain Products may be add-ons or otherwise deeply integrated with third-party applications and platforms ("Integrated Partners"), such as Atlassian or Slack. For these Products, the number, rights, and scope of Authorized Users must not exceed or conflict with the terms outlined in the Integrated Partner's EULA or other applicable terms and conditions. This Agreement will be limited, as needed, to align with the Integrated Partner's EULA or terms and conditions.

### 6.2 Third-Party Service Terms

Products may include features that integrate with third-party services, as outlined in our Privacy Policy and DPA. The terms of this Agreement will be adjusted, as necessary, to ensure consistency with the EULA or terms and conditions of these third-party service providers.

---

## 7. Software Terms

The following terms, unless otherwise stated, apply to Software (and not Hosting Services).

### 7.1 Your License Rights

- **License Grant:** Teams Work gives you a non-exclusive, non-sub-licensable, and non-transferable license to install and use the Software according to this Agreement.
- **License Term:** The License Term is stated in your Order. However, it will end if this Agreement is terminated, even if it's listed as "perpetual" or has no end date in the Order.
- **Default Term:** If not specified, the License Term is 12 months starting from when you receive the license keys, access, or installation ability.

### 7.2 Number of Instances

Unless otherwise stated in your Order, each Software license allows for one production instance on your systems (or those of your service providers, for which you remain responsible).

### 7.3 Attribution

- **Required Attribution:** You must include "Powered by Teams Work" on all user interfaces where attribution is required.
- **No Removal:** Do not remove, hide, or change any other attributions included in the Software.

### 7.4 Evaluation Licenses

Refer to the section on No-Charge Products for details.

### 7.5 System Requirements

You must ensure your systems meet the necessary hardware, software, and other requirements for the Software. It's your responsibility to check that your systems are suitable for the Software you use.

### 7.6 Private Blockchain Functionality

7.6.1 The Software may include a private blockchain mechanism for storing audit data. This process may require additional computational resources.

7.6.2 No audit data is sent to any public or third-party blockchain and retained within the instance. All blockchain functionality is self-contained and designed to make tampering more difficult.

7.6.3 You acknowledge that any modification to historical audit entries beyond the Software, even if performed by qualified personnel, will be detectable and will create an immutable record of such changes, potentially affecting the entire audit chain.

7.6.4 Teams Work Ltd makes no representation that the private blockchain is fully immune to tampering, nor that it guarantees absolute data immutability. This mechanism relies on generating unique digital identifiers (e.g., a nonce and a matching hash) for each record, thus binding new records to all previous ones. Any attempt to alter a past record requires recalculating the hashes for all subsequent records, creating significant computational complexity. While the increasing number of audits strengthens confidence in the chain's integrity, it does not eliminate the possibility of tampering entirely. By using the system, you acknowledge and accept that, although robust, the private blockchain may still be vulnerable to highly complex or advanced modification attempts.

**7.6.5 Alterations to Historical Data**

- 7.6.5.1 Teams Work Ltd may, at its sole discretion, refuse any request to amend or alter historical audit data.
- 7.6.5.2 Any such alterations are not part of the standard support and maintenance services. If you require modifications, you must enter into a separate written agreement with Teams Work Ltd on a case-by-case basis.
- 7.6.5.3 If Teams Work Ltd consents to make an alteration, it disclaims any further responsibility for maintaining the overall audit integrity after implementing those changes.
- 7.6.5.4 All permitted alterations will be recorded in an additional ledger or log, which Teams Work Ltd can provide for external audits upon request.
- 7.6.5.5 Any attempt to alter historical audit data beyond the Software's authorized functionality or without Teams Work Ltd's explicit written permission constitutes a material breach of this Agreement and must be reported to Teams Work Ltd immediately.

**7.6.6 Disaster Recovery and Data Loss**

- 7.6.6.1 While the private blockchain enhances security and reliability by recording immutable transaction hashes, it does not protect against data loss nor serve as a replacement for a comprehensive disaster recovery plan.
- 7.6.6.2 Regular backups, redundant storage solutions, and well-maintained disaster recovery protocols remain essential to safeguard your data.
- 7.6.6.3 By using this system, you acknowledge that implementing and maintaining such practices is your responsibility and is necessary to ensure data continuity and ability to data recovery.

---

## 8. Responsibility for Your Data

8.1 We retain none of your data. Your data is your responsibility — ensure it complies with local laws and standards.

---

## 9. Support and Maintenance

Teams Work will offer Support and Maintenance for the Products as described, but only for the period covered by your payment. You need to give Teams Work reasonable access to your materials, systems, personnel, or other resources, including your instances of the Software, as needed for them to provide Support and Maintenance.

---

## 10. Financial Terms

### 10.1 Atlassian Apps Delivery and Payment

We will send you license keys (for Software) or login instructions (for Hosted Services) to the email addresses listed in your Order once we've received your payment. All deliveries will be electronic. You're responsible for installing any Software, and neither Teams Work nor Atlassian will have further delivery obligations after providing the license keys. License keys will be delivered by Atlassian through the Atlassian Marketplace for Teams Work unless otherwise arranged.

You can request a refund or an exchange/upgrade for your commercial or academic server license within 30 days of purchase, or as specified in your Order. After 30 days, upgrades will follow standard pricing, and refunds or exchanges won't be available.

When you make payments, you understand that you're not relying on the availability of Products beyond the current License or Subscription Term, or on future upgrades or features. If you add Authorized Users during your License or Subscription Term, you'll be billed for them in the next billing cycle at the current rates. You agree that the Atlassian Marketplace may charge your credit card for renewals, additional users, and any unpaid fees.

---

## 11. Taxes

Your payments under this Agreement do not include any taxes or duties that might apply in the location where the payment is made or received. If any taxes or duties are due, you must pay these amounts to Teams Work on top of any fees you owe. However, if you have a tax or duty exemption, you can provide proof of this to Teams Work. We will then make reasonable efforts to issue the necessary invoices so you can try to get a refund or credit from the relevant tax authority if one is available.

---

## 12. Malicious Use

12.1 You must not use the Products for any harmful purposes. Harmful purposes include, but are not limited to:

- 12.1.1 Using the Products in a way that damages or disrupts their operation, security, or accessibility.
- 12.1.2 Using harmful code, such as spyware, viruses, or malware.
- 12.1.3 Using the Products for illegal, fraudulent, or harmful activities, including misrepresentation or infringement of intellectual property rights, abusive or threatening behavior, or defamation.
- 12.1.4 Using the Products in a way that a reasonable person would consider malicious.
- 12.1.5 Using the Products in violation of local laws.

You must protect and compensate Teams Work for any claims, damages, or costs resulting from your use of the Products for harmful purposes.

If Teams Work believes, reasonably and at its sole discretion, that you are using the Products for harmful purposes, we can immediately suspend or terminate your access. No refund will be provided in such cases.

---

## 13. No-Charge Products and Beta Versions

We may, at our discretion, offer certain Products for free or with limited functionality, such as free accounts, for evaluation, trial use, or access to Beta Versions ("No-Charge Products"). Your use of No-Charge Products is governed by this EULA and any additional terms we provide, and is only allowed for the period we specify (or 30 days if not specified).

No-Charge Products might not have full functionality. If a No-Charge Product is provided for evaluation, it is only for the Evaluation Period, during which you can use the Product with limited temporary access. After the Evaluation Period ends, the Product will stop working, and you must delete all copies. If not specified, the Evaluation Period is 30 days.

You cannot use No-Charge Products for competitive analysis or similar activities. We may terminate your use of No-Charge Products at any time for any reason without liability. Beta Versions, which are still in development, may have more errors and are not guaranteed to be released as full products. We might charge for access to Beta Versions, but they will still be subject to the terms for No-Charge Products. All information about Beta Versions is confidential. We disclaim all obligations related to No-Charge Products, including support, warranties, and indemnities.

---

## 14. Restrictions

- 14.4.1 You must not engage in any action intended to artificially reduce or obscure the actual number of Authorized Users of the Products.
- 14.4.2 Using a trial or evaluation license for production purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes a material breach of this Agreement.

### 14.5 Enforcement for Manipulation

14.5.1 If we detect license manipulation or misuse, we may immediately suspend or terminate your access in accordance with Section 17 (Term and Termination), without refund.

---

## 15. Ownership and Feedback

Products are provided to you under a limited license or access, and you do not own them, regardless of terms like "purchase" or "sale." Teams Work and its licensors retain all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the Products (including No-Charge Products) and any related technology.

If you send us comments, questions, ideas, or other feedback ("Feedback"), Teams Work can use, copy, share, license, and exploit that Feedback freely, without any obligation to you. Your Feedback will not be treated as confidential, and Teams Work can use and develop products based on your Feedback or independently.

---

## 16. Confidentiality

16.1 Except as stated otherwise in this Agreement, both parties agree that any code, inventions, business details, technical data, or financial information shared by one party ("Disclosing Party") with the other party ("Receiving Party") is confidential ("Confidential Information"). The Receiving Party must keep this information confidential and not use or share it without permission.

16.2 The Receiving Party's obligation to keep information confidential does not apply if the information can be shown to:

- 16.2.1 have been already known by the Receiving Party before receiving it, without any confidentiality obligation;
- 16.2.2 be public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party;
- 16.2.3 be lawfully obtained from a third party without breaching any confidentiality agreement;
- 16.2.4 be independently developed by the Receiving Party's employees who had no access to the Confidential Information.
- 16.2.5 The Receiving Party may also disclose Confidential Information if required by law, regulation, or court order, but only to the extent necessary and with advance notice to the Disclosing Party.

16.3 The Receiving Party understands that unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information could cause significant harm. Therefore, the Disclosing Party is entitled to seek legal remedies, including equitable relief.

16.4 Both parties can disclose Confidential Information if required by law. If this happens, the Receiving Party will make reasonable efforts to notify the Disclosing Party as soon as legally possible.

## 17. Term and Termination

- The breach is not fixed within 30 days after written notice, or
- The breach is something that cannot be fixed.

Either party can also terminate the Agreement if the other party stops operating, goes bankrupt, or cannot meet its financial obligations.

Either party may end the Agreement at any time for convenience with 30 days' written notice. However, if you end it for convenience, you won't get any credits or refunds for unused Software, and any unpaid fees before termination are still due.

After termination, you and your Authorised Users must stop using or accessing the Products, delete all copies from your systems, and provide written confirmation, though you can keep minimal copies for legal reasons.
